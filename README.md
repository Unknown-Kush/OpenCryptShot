# OpenCryptShot
## Don't get scammed out of 500$. This shit took an hour to program.
#### WARNING: THIS IS THE FIRST COMMIT OF THIS PROJECT AND IS UNTESTED. IT PROBABLY DOES NOT EVEN WORK. YET. DO NOT TEST IT WITH ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO LOSE.

The open source development of the project will be centralized here as well as [in our Discord server](https://discord.gg/vJkF3cwZDy)(where you can be notified as the bot moves out of alpha testing). 
I will test and fix any bug in a few hours or days... who knows :-)

Open source clone of the simple crypto pumps bot some dudes are selling for 500$
